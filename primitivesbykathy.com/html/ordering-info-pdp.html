                    We are a wholesale company, so we require all customers to
                    submit a tax exempt number prior to receiving our catalog or ordering
                    product. Customers must be prepared to provide a copy
                    of a valid state tax ID upon request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web order requirement is $50 and there are minimum order
                    requirements per item as well. The order must be in multiples
                    of each itemâ€™s requirement. If the minimum for an item is not
                    ordered, it will automatically be adjusted to the next higher number.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be aware that if your back order falls below $50 it may be
                    cancelled without notification.

                    A variety of factors play a role in the actual shipping time of an

                    Please let us know at the time of the order if you are in need of a
